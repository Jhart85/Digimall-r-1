# Digimall-r-1
Digimall r-1 will contain the Blueprints to my new project "Digital Mall' that will link with my 'Encrypted' project.
My name is Jeremiah Hart. I'm 35yrs old fairly educated & built, launched & own/run my first digital statup business Named, " CryptoVision Help & Info HUB". 
For clear rasons I shorttend the name to just "CryptoVision Inc.".
Under "CryptoVision Inc." lay my entities "Vision HUB","MAD Motivation","Hustle-Estates","Black STAG clothing", & last but not lest, "Encrypted".
Digimall is the Newst to the team providing a personal or business concierge service to those who want or may need help majority of the digital world.
In a sense I'm building a multi lane bridge to wherever it may be the user needs/wants to visit. 
Example: A user wants to launch thier digital startup but he/she is still unsure whats all needed to do that,so, he/she reach out & like what we offer. He/she would explain the follwing.: I want to launch my first digital startup but i'm not sure what all i need to do, can you help me?
At this point we would have our content ready of which would contain the 32 must have documents EVERY startup needs, Business plan, Business Pitch, Business proposal, & business capital. Depending on if the user has a business budget or any strateic business development outline we help or not. I have THOUSANDS of hours in business develoment content & MUCH MUCH MORE.
